hello, good afternoon Miss Maryam, I hope you are very well, I am super happy, I have finished my speech recognition course and I want to share my achievement with you, with the things learned in this course I managed to do the application the other day, and now I have learned new things related to audio management, I leave you the link to my accreditation and below a summary of what I saw in the course, if I had to describe my skills in python I would say that today I am at the right level to learn anything, I like working with machine learning more but I am also willing to do back end, hehe now I can improve my application and create other similar ones with speech recognition
